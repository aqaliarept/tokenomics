2026-07-01 - Curriculum game-master Stage 0 + Stage 1 scaffold (EXP-0023)
Status: DONE + reviewed. CURRICULUM_GAME_MASTER_APPROACH.md "Immediate Next Experiment"
  implemented via TDD. New `tokenomics/eval/curriculum.py`: TaskRecord (jsonl 1:1
  roundtrip), generator-ref replay (world_spec={generator,params} -> vetted pure
  REPRODUCERS builder, no hidden state), stress_suite() (18 labeled tasks, separate from
  any train replay), classify_failure() (6-way taxonomy, one class/row), run_replay_suite()
  (learner vs entity_planner+proportional on same replayed world), main() emitter.
  Three P2 review fixes landed: (A) replay anchored at record.episode_seed; (B) target_depth
  from recipe chain (_chain_depth), never blank; (C) Stage 1 telemetry cols
  (learner/reference rejected_units + reference_model_id).
Artifacts: experiments/EXP-0023-curriculum-task-archive-and-stress-suite/ (spec.json,
  RESULT.md, summary.csv, artifacts/{task_archive.jsonl, curriculum_matrix.csv}).
  tests/test_curriculum.py (16 pass). Full suite 491 passed, 0 regressions.
  Stack under test = portable producer_scorer_broad.pt (EXP-0021) + orderer_scorer.pt
  (EXP-0012); legacy champion.json untouched (historical baseline only).
Decisions: generator-ref reproducibility (not inline world_spec) for Stage 0/1 — fixtures
  are already pure(seed,**params); inline dump deferred to Stage 2's random generator.
  No champion change, no promotion (scaffolding). CLAUDE.md HARD RULE tightened: every EXP
  run -> Runpod; only smoke/quick diagnostics local.
Blockers: hard-case mining (Stage 3) is blocked on REFERENCE STRENGTH, not the learner —
  the deterministic entity_planner+proportional bar is beaten by the learner on every live
  task (0 policy_weakness across 18), so it can't surface gaps. Need a stronger reference
  (local routing / bounded short-rollout search) before mining is meaningful.
Next: (1) wire the stronger reference bar (search) into run_replay_task; then Stage 2 broad
  legal randomization + inline world_spec, or Stage 3 mining on the stronger bar.
  (2) Re-run EXP-0023 full replay on a Runpod pod via run_pod_training.py --pull to make the
  canonical artifacts cloud-produced per the tightened rule (was run local pre-tightening;
  deterministic, so identical output expected).

2026-07-01 - Stronger reference bar wired (EXP-0024) — blocker (1) above DONE
Status: DONE. `REFERENCE_BARS` registry in eval/curriculum.py: added `entity_planner+mpc_search`
  (producer fixed at entity_planner; orderer routing re-chosen per cycle by lookahead=6 rollout
  over {even_split, proportional} + 8 sampled routings via search_orderer_episode; deterministic
  given seed, no ckpt) beside the fixed practical bar. `run_replay_task` gains opt-in
  `reference_bars` → reference = STRONGEST of the set, winning bar id attributed per row
  (`reference_model_id`); DEFAULT single practical bar keeps EXP-0023 + old tests byte-identical.
  CLI `--reference-bars`. TDD: 3 new tests (registry, bars-run, best-of selection), full suite 494 pass.
Artifacts: experiments/EXP-0024-curriculum-reference-strength/ (spec.json, RESULT.md, summary.csv,
  artifacts/{curriculum_matrix.csv, task_archive.jsonl}). Ran on Runpod CPU pod (--cpu --python
  python3.12), pulled back. Same 18-task suite + same portable stack as EXP-0023; only ref changed.
Result: histogram {policy_weakness: 2, none: 2, distribution_mismatch: 13, feasibility_wall: 1}
  (was {none: 4, ...}). FIRST in-claim policy_weakness in the arc: search bar beats learner on
  scale-d3-s6 (493.3>491.3) and s7 (499>496.7) — `none` under the fixed bar. Taxonomy holds
  (scarcity-degraded search>learner but out_of_claim → distribution_mismatch, not miscounted).
Decisions: reference = best-of-available-bars, per-row attributable. No learner change, no promotion.
  CLAUDE.md got a concrete 7-step cloud-run recipe (ckpt-staging gotcha: driver syncs inner
  tokenomics/ pkg dir, NOT repo root → stage input ckpts under tokenomics/_pod_ckpts/; CPU pod
  needs --cpu --python python3.12; detached driver, --attach — old foreground caveat was stale).
Blockers: the 2 in-claim gaps are NARROW (≤0.5%, ~2 units, only 2/4 held-out seeds). Before Stage 3
  trains on them, need a paired-seed/trace check (doc close-win rule) to rule out search-sampling
  noise; or sharpen the bar (more samples/lookahead, more compute).
Next: Stage 2 broad legal randomization + inline world_spec, OR Stage 3 mining a large random pool
  against the mpc_search bar (with the paired-seed guard on narrow gaps).
